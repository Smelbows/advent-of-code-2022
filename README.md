## Advent of code

#### Day one

Puzzles complete, project setup still a work in progress, let's ignore it for now, hey?

#### Day two

Don't like the method, let's find a better way ;)

#### Day three

Much quicker than day 2

#### Day four

Think this one's neat. The thing I like about it is the pure functions. Super testable. I wonder if there's some other neat ways to do it.
